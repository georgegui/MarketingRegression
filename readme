- this package also requires another helper function package CommonFunctions
- for convenience, save the CommonFunctions and DemandEstimation folders under the same path, I save them in
  '~/Workspace-George', so I recommend replacing all '~/Workspace-George' with your own path.
- the R/ folder contains necessary functions that could be compiled
- the main_scripts/ contains main demand estimation scripts
