    promotion_interaction_own             ,0,whether include own promotion interaction,little variation for promoted price
    promotion_interaction_all             ,0,whether include promotion interaction of both own and competing brands,
    n_max_competing_brands                ,5,the maximum number of competing brands considered for each module,limit the dimension of the estimation
    lhs_perc_total_revenue_covered        ,0.8,the percentage of overall revenue covered by top brands selected as LHS variables,"filter small products, the overall revenue is the sum of revenues of all products in all categories"
    rhs_perc_module_revenue_covered       ,0.8,the percentage of module revenue covered by top brands selected as RHS controls,filter small product controls within a category
    min_nstores_per_zip3                  ,5,the minimum number of stores per ZIP3 for a ZIP3 to be selected,too few stores in a zip3 does not work well with regional-time controls
    min_nstores_per_chain                 ,5,the minimum number of stores per Chain for a Chain to be selected,"In an IV model that were previously tried, Hausman instruments relies on the price of other stores in the same Chain"
    min_nstores_per_brand                 ,5,the minimum number of stores per brand for a brand to be selected,too few stores in a brand does not work well with regional-time controls
    min_nweeks_per_store_brand            ,120,the minimum number of week observation per store brand combination,too few data-points in an estimation can be problematic
    min_nzip3s_per_chain              ,1,the minimum number of ZIP3 per Chain for a Chain to be selected,The IV model would not work if a chain only exists in one region
    min_nprices_per_store_brand           ,4,the minimum number of unique prices per store brand combination,"too few price variation lead to all kinds of collinearity, usually with promotion, in Sparse regression "

    remove_0_sale_weeks                   ,0,whether to remove weeks with 0 sales,"if the actual sale of a 0-sale observation in a brand store is systematically higher than log(1), the estimation may have problems"
    min_nonzero_sales_perc_per_store_brand,0,the minimum percentage of 0 sales per per store brand combination,some stores have a high percentage of 0 sales that the estimations seem to not make sense
    demean_before_estimation              ,1,whether to demean before the estimation,"demean before estimation result in faster estimation at the cost of not strictly following FWL theorem; will be 1 for Bayes and OLS_demean, and 0 for others"
