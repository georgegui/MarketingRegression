# DemandEstimation
This repository estimates the price elasticities of the Nielsen dataset 
- this package also requires another helper function package CommonFunctions
- for convenience, save the CommonFunctions and DemandEstimation folders under the same path, I save them in
  '~/Workspace-George', so I recommend replacing all '~/Workspace-George' with your own path.
- the main_scripts/ contains main demand estimation scripts
- the R/ folder contains necessary functions that could be compiled. It's cleaner to build the package before running the main_scripts.
- The 'main_scripts/1_Settings.R' will choose the setting depending on nodename, so it's important to include your own computer nodename.
